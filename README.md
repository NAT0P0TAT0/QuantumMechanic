Make sure you're using Unity 2017

Recommend using github for windows program so you can have a local copy thats easy to sync

Levels can be accessed from the Resources Folder, the avilable colours are in the 'level key' image in the Assets folder<br />
(When adding new levels keep in mind they must be png and you have to enable read/write on them in unity)
